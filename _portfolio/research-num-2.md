The Equivalent Source Method (ESM) finds extensive application in computational acoustics, especially in addressing complex boundary-value problems. Our objective is to develop numerical tools capable of addressing various engineering challenges, ranging from acoustic design in engines and ventilation systems to sound propagation in ice-covered oceans, utilizing the ESM. Specifically, we enhance the capabilities of ESM, a boundary integral-based method traditionally limited to homogeneous media, to address inhomogeneous media.

Large-scale 3D underwater acoustic propagation
======
3D full-wave simulations are essential for benchmarking underwater acoustic propagation with complex topographies. They are also useful for investigating 3D propagation effects, such as horizontal refraction and transverse coupling. Nevertheless, conducting 3D full-wave simulations using existing numerical approaches like FEM and BEM has been challenging due to limited computational resources. To address this challenge, we developed a powerful new numerical tool capable of handling the complex stratified ocean environment. In particular, computational efficiency is significantly enhanced by O(N1-2) compared with conventional numerical methods.

Based on this approach, we can implement the large-scale 3D underwater acoustic propagation using realastic bathmetry dataset with very high accurcy. This would be very useful for benchmarking and investigating 3D propagation effects. It somehow becomes very suitable for generating time-domain simulations, as shown down below. Check our recent work for more detail.

We also extend the ESM-based model's capability to handle sound propagation in the ice-covered ocean. The developped model can capture the detailed propagation characteristic of both acoutic and elasic waves traveling within an ice/water coupled system. See the clip given down below for the demonstration using the developed model. Check our recent work for more detail.
