The Equivalent Source Method (ESM) finds extensive application in computational acoustics, especially in addressing complex boundary-value problems. Our objective is to develop numerical tools capable of addressing various engineering challenges, ranging from acoustic design in engines and ventilation systems to sound propagation in ice-covered oceans, utilizing the ESM. Specifically, we enhance the capabilities of ESM, a boundary integral-based method traditionally limited to homogeneous media, to address inhomogeneous media.
