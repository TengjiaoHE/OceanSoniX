Funding
======
* 01.2024 – 12.2026: <b>NSFC for Young Scientists</b> (National level, 38K€) which supports me to work as an individual PI to study the mechanism of acoustic Fano resonances and the avoid-crossing behavior in a waveguide with an object.
* 05.2023 – 05.2025: <b>Stable Support Funding from NKLUAT</b> (64K€) which supports me to work as an individual PI to develop a deep learning neural network to real-time predict large-scale, 3D underwater sound propagation.
* 10.2018 – 11.2019: <b>CSC (China)-ISVR (Soton, UK) joint project</b> (15K€) which supports me to work as a visiting research student with Prof. Victor. F Humphrey and conduct theoretical and numerical study on developing standardization of underwater noise measurements for commercial vessels in shallow water.
