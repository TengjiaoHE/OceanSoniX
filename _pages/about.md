Tengjiao He (何腾蛟) is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in Shanghai, China. He received his B.S. degree in Ocean Technology from Dalian Ocean University (DOU) in 2014 and his Ph.D. in Underwater Acoustic Engineering from Harbin Engineering University (HEU) in 2022. From October 2018 to November 2019, he was a visiting scholar at the University of Southampton, UK, working with the Acoustics Group led by Prof. Victor F. Humphrey. Since December 2022, he has been a postdoctoral researcher under the supervision of Prof. Jun Fan at SJTU.


Research interests
======
Dr. Tengjiao He's research interests encompass underwater acoustics, computational acoustics, and acoustics in moving media, employing analytical, numerical, and experimental methods. More specifically, His current work focuses on developing efficient methods for modeling large-scale, 3D underwater sound propagation from both omnidirectional and directional sources, as well as investigating the mechanisms of Fano resonance scattering in ocean waveguides for scattering manipulation.
