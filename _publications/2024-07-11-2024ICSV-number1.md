##Abstract
This study investigates the resonance frequency shift of a submerged cylindrical aluminum shell, due to boundary reflections. Utilizing the finite element method, this paper numerically simulates the
effects of external loading by the water surface, exploring the dependence of the shell's resonance frequency shift on submerged depth. The experimental and numerical findings consistently demonstrate that the resonance frequency of the shell decreases as the submerged depth increases. Moreover, it is found that the resonance frequency shift weakens when the shell is vertically oriented, with its circumference paralleled to the horizontal plane. Additionally, The work provides a critical submerged depth below which the resonance frequency shift ceases to occur.
