## Abstract

The advancement of unmanned platforms is driving the miniaturization and cost reduction of the multi-beam echosounder (MBES). In the process of MBES array calibration, the mutual coupling significantly impacts the performance of parameter estimation. We propose a correction method to mitigate the mutual coupling effects in the calibration of MBES acoustic array. Initially, a near-field focused beamforming model is established to assess the influence of mutual coupling. Subsequently, the covariance matrix in the frequency domain is constructed to enhance algorithm efficiency and simplify solution procedures. This construction eliminates the need for a low-pass filtering step after heterodyning through extracting peak values near zero frequency in the signal frequency domain. Meanwhile, the Toeplitz property is leveraged to render the estimation results independent of the mutual coupling matrix. Finally, the mutual coupling coefficients and the direction of arrival (DOA) are joint-estimated and the Cramér–Rao bound is derived. The presented method effectively addresses the engineering challenge of MBES mutual coupling calibration. Additionally, the performance of the proposed method is verified through the measured data in simulation and tank experiments.
